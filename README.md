# Hello there 👨🏿‍💻

I am a Freelance Full Stack Developer with a passion for design. My career started with getting a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from UTSA as well as learning to code becoming a developer. Now, I bridge the gap between technical development and creative design, combining my skills to build websites and applications that are not only functional but also visually engaging.
